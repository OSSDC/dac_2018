    "This reference design will help you walk through the rules of the contest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note:\n",
    "1. Any change in `preprocessing.py` will make your design fail in evaluation. This file should not be changed.\n",
    "2. Only \"resize\" is allowed on PS side. Any other inference executed on PS side would be regarded as fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time for a batch processing should start before \"PS reading images\" and end after \"PS receiving all results\". \n",
    "Please check the reference for details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Batch size is 500 by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please write your results using the methods `write()` and `save_results_xml()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is your choice how to record the inference result. \n",
    "However, it must be readable, and you must convert it to XML files. An example is provided.\n",
    "Please pack your code into `teamname.py`. \n",
    "Your design should be able to process all evaluation images with one click.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have any question, please contact [Xinyi Zhang at University of Pittsburgh](mailto:xinyizhang@pitt.edu).\n",
